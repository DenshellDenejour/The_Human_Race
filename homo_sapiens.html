  <p> Racism, xenophobia and intolerance are frequent problems in all societies. But each and every one of us plays a role every day in either contributing to or breaking down racial prejudices and bigoted attitudes.  In biology, race refers to the groups into which some species are subdivided on the basis of phenotypic traits, from a series of characteristics that are transmitted by genetic inheritance. The term race began to be used in the 16th century and had its boom in the 19th century, even adopting a taxonomic category equivalent to a subspecies. In 1905, the International Botanical Congress removed the taxonomic value of race for plants. Its use remains in the common language and is very frequent when it comes to domestic animals.

In the case of the human being (Homo sapiens), specialists affirm that the use of the term race to refer to each of the various or different human groups is inappropriate, and it is considered that it is more appropriate to use the terms ethnicity or population to define them. . Furthermore, scientists consider that when referring to human beings, biogenetically, "races" do not exist, dealing only with social interpretations.</p>
  
  <p>In taxonomy breed is an informal category in the taxonomic hierarchy for which various definitions exist. Sometimes it is used to denote a level below that of a subspecies, while at other times it is used as a synonym for subspecies. It has been used as a higher rank than strain, with several strains making up one breed. Breeds may be genetically distinct populations of individuals within the same species, or they may be defined in other ways, eg geographically or physiologically. Genetic isolation between breeds is not complete, but genetic differences may have accumulated that are not (yet) sufficient to separate species.

The term is recognized by some scientists, but is not governed by any of the formal codes of biological nomenclature. Taxonomic units below the subspecies level do not apply to animals.

If the breeds are sufficiently different or have been tested to show little genetic connection regardless of phenotype, two or more breeds may be identified as subspecies or other infraspecific rank, and assigned a name. Ernst Mayr wrote that a subspecies may be "a geographical race that is taxonomically different enough to deserve a separate name".

Study of populations of preliminarily tagged breeds can sometimes lead to the classification of a new species. For example, in 2008, two populations of leafhoppers (Nilaparvata lugens) in the Philippines, one adapted to feed on rice and the other on Leersia hexandra grass, were reclassified into "two distinct sympatric species" but closely related, based on low rate. survival when given the opposite food source, barriers to hybridization between populations, uniform mating preference between members of the same population, differences in mating sounds, oviposition variations, and other distinguishable characteristics .20‚Äã

For pathogenic bacteria adapted to particular hosts, races may be formally referred to as pathovars. For parasitic organisms governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the term forma specialis (plural formae specials) is used. </p>

  <p> On May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after a convenience store employee called 911 and told the police that Mr. Floyd had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Seventeen minutes after the first squad car arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three police officers, showing no signs of life.

By combining videos from bystanders and security cameras, reviewing official documents and consulting experts, The New York Times reconstructed in detail the minutes leading to Mr. Floyd's death. Our video shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for help.

The day after Mr. Floyd's death, the Police Department fired all four of the officers involved in the episode. On May 29, the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, announced third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges against Derek Chauvin, the officer seen most clearly in witness videos pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds, according to a Times analysis of timestamped video. Our video investigation shows that Mr. Chauvin did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene. </p>
